# Product Requirements Document (PRD)  
**Product:** MVP CRM Web App  
**Author:** [Your Name]  
**Date:** [Today’s Date]  
**Status:** Draft

## 1. Overview
A lightweight CRM (Customer Relationship Management) web app designed as an MVP to help small businesses manage customer contacts, track interactions, and monitor simple deal pipelines.  

The goal is **minimal but usable features**: focus on core workflows instead of broad enterprise-level CRM features.  

---

## 2. Objectives
- Provide a simple way for users to **store and manage customer data**.  
- Enable **basic pipeline/deal tracking** to follow sales progress.  
- Allow **logging customer interactions** (calls, emails, notes).  
- Keep the **UI clean and fast** to support quick adoption.  

---

## 3. Target Users
- Small business owners  
- Freelancers managing clients  
- Early-stage sales teams  

---

## 4. Scope (MVP Features)

### 4.1 Core Features
1. **User Authentication**  
   - Sign up, login, logout (email + password)  
   - Basic role: single-user (no multi-tenant at MVP stage)  

2. **Contacts Management**  
   - Create, edit, delete contacts  
   - Fields: name, email, phone, company, notes  

3. **Pipeline / Deals**  
   - Simple Kanban board (e.g., columns: *Lead → In Progress → Won → Lost*)  
   - Ability to create, move, update deals  
   - Link deals to contacts  

4. **Activity Tracking**  
   - Log simple notes or interactions (text only for MVP)  
   - Attach activity to a contact or deal  

5. **Basic Dashboard / List View**  
   - List of contacts  
   - List of deals by stage  

---

### 4.2 Nice-to-Have (Out of MVP Scope)  
- Multi-user collaboration (teams)  
- Email integration  
- File attachments  
- Reminders/notifications  
- Analytics/Reports  

---

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Tech stack suggestion (for codegen):**  
  - Frontend: React (with Zustand/React Query for state/data fetching)  
  - Backend: Node.js (Express) + Prisma ORM  
  - Database: PostgreSQL  
  - Auth: JWT (basic session handling)  
- **Performance:** <300ms response time for core API calls  
- **Security:** Passwords hashed (bcrypt)  
- **Scalability:** Single DB instance is fine for MVP

## 6. User Stories

### Authentication  
- As a user, I want to sign up and log in so I can access my CRM data.  

### Contacts  
- As a user, I want to create a contact with basic info so I can store customer details.  
- As a user, I want to edit or delete contacts when details change.  

### Deals  
- As a user, I want to add a deal linked to a contact so I can track opportunities.  
- As a user, I want to drag and drop deals across stages so I can manage my pipeline visually.  

### Activities  
- As a user, I want to log notes or interactions so I can remember what was discussed.  

### Dashboard  
- As a user, I want to see a list of contacts and deals so I can quickly access my work.  

---

## 7. Success Metrics
- Users can add, edit, delete contacts.  
- Users can create and update deals across pipeline stages.  
- Users can log at least one activity per contact/deal.  
- No critical errors during core workflows.  

---

## 8. Wireframe (Conceptual)
```
[ Sidebar ] [ Dashboard View ]
- Contacts    -> List of contacts (Name, Email, Company, Actions)
- Deals       -> Kanban Board (Lead | In Progress | Won | Lost)
- Activities  -> Notes linked to contacts/deals
```

---

## 9. Open Questions
- Do we need multi-tenant support (multiple businesses/users) in MVP or single-user only?  
- Should we support import/export (CSV) at MVP?  
- Should deals have value/amount field or just text description?
