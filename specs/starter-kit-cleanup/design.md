# Design - Starter Kit with Basic CRM Features

## Technical Architecture

### System Overview
Keep the current CRM features as example implementation to demonstrate:
- Database design patterns
- Server actions and queries
- Component architecture
- Full-stack capabilities

### Current State (Keep All)
**Core Infrastructure:**
- ✅ Next.js 15.3 with App Router
- ✅ Supabase integration (client/server)
- ✅ TypeScript with generated types
- ✅ Authentication system
- ✅ Docker containerization

**Example Features (Keep as Demo):**
- ✅ User profiles
- ✅ Contacts management
- ✅ Deals pipeline

- ✅ CRM dashboard

### Database Design (Keep Current)
```sql
profiles     # User authentication
contacts     # Example CRUD operations
deals        # Example relationships
activities   # Example many-to-many
deal_stages  # Example enum/lookup tables
```

### Component Architecture (Keep Current)
```
components/
├── ui/              # shadcn/ui base components
└── features/
    ├── auth/        # Authentication forms
    └── crm/         # Example feature components
```
